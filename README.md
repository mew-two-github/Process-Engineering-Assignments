# Process-Engineering-Assignments
Assignments given in the capstone project course Process Engineering (CH4250), Spring 2022. These assignments are meant for us to be familiarised with ASPEN.
## Assignment-1:
* Distillation column simulation; all properties specified. Liquid-vapour composition and outlet concentrations are asked.
## Assignment-2:
* Output concentration and Distillation column trays fixed, need to design temperature, pressure, reflux ratios and distillate to feed ratio
* Design & Vary for radfrac distillation column unit.
* Tradeoff between the number of trays and reboiler heat duty
## Assignment-3:
* Full Process Simulation
* Equipment Sizing ASPEN tool
## Assignment-4:
* Captal and operating costs estimation
* Optimising total cost by dealing with capital vs operating costs tradeoff
## Assignment-5:
* Full process simulation with 
  * unit conditions determined by design and vary
  * Waste outlet constraint
* Sensitivity Analysis
* Process Flow Diagram (use https://app.diagrams.net/)
